okay, well the first question is easy
health is dependent on
-constitution score
-class(s)
-sometimes bonus things but mostly the first two
strength is the stat used for determining physical things, how well someone can complete various physical tasks, how effectively they hit with certain weapons, etc.
defense is, different? like i think that would be armour class, which is how hard you are to hit (which can come from a mixture of how evasive you are and how well armoured you are)
and then leveling up depends on who's running the game
most DMs don't actually use the XP system ngl, they run milestone games
i mean i do that when I DM
d20 is rolled the most often
d4, d6, d8, d10 and d12 are also all important
and typically you'll have 2d10 so you can roll percentile (d100)


Add races, weapons, tools, proficiency, skills, spells


Your character’s hit points define how tough your character is in combat and other dangerous situations. Your hit points are determined by your Hit Dice (short for Hit Point Dice).

At 1st level, your character has 1 Hit Die, and the die type is determined by your class. You start with hit points equal to the highest roll of that die, as indicated in your class description. (You also add your Constitution modifier, which you’ll determine in step 3.) This is also your hit point maximum.

Record your character’s hit points on your character sheet. Also record the type of Hit Die your character uses and the number of Hit Dice you have. After you rest, you can spend Hit Dice to regain hit points
