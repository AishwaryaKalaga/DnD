Dice Class - Where the dice are rolled
Test - Essentially a main method, but specifically for testing aspects of the other classes. 
Game - The game itself
Main - Where the game is played
Character - Character properties
Levels - 
High score - hashmap implemation

okay, well the first question is easy
health is dependent on
-constitution score
-class(s)
-sometimes bonus things but mostly the first two
strength is the stat used for determining physical things, how well someone can complete various physical tasks, how effectively they hit with certain weapons, etc.
defense is, different? like i think that would be armour class, which is how hard you are to hit (which can come from a mixture of how evasive you are and how well armoured you are)
and then leveling up depends on who's running the game
most DMs don't actually use the XP system ngl, they run milestone games
i mean i do that when I DM
d20 is rolled the most often
d4, d6, d8, d10 and d12 are also all important
and typically you'll have 2d10 so you can roll percentile (d100)
